sklearn:

new dataset. 5/5

random forest 5/5

GridSearchCV 5/5

Scatterplot 5/5

Belief Networks:

alarm queries 5/5

car queries 5/5

additional node 2/5 - you have two car_starts nodes.

HMM:

load 5/5

generate 10/10

lander models 5/5

forward 10/10

viterbi 11/15 - your main doesn't work right; I had to fix the command line args.
Also, it works with lander and cat, but not the whole ambiguous_sents.obs file.

Utility:

q1 5/5

q2 5/5

q3 2/2

q4 3/3

q5 1/2 - if it's not rocky, we take r1.

q6 3/3
